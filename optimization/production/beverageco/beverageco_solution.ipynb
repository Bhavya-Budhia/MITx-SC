    "# BeverageCo: Multi-period Production Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Background\n",
    "BeverageCo produces three types of beverages: Premium Soda, Energy Drink, and Sparkling Water. They need to plan production over a 6-month horizon considering:\n",
    "- Seasonal demand patterns\n",
    "- Production line setup costs and times\n",
    "- Limited shelf life for products\n",
    "- Storage capacity constraints\n",
    "- Workforce scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "- Premium Soda has highest profit margin but shortest shelf life (3 months)\n",
    "- Energy Drink has medium margin and 4-month shelf life\n",
    "- Sparkling Water has lowest margin but 6-month shelf life\n",
    "- Storage costs increase in summer months (refrigeration)\n",
    "- Demand peaks during summer (months 3-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Goals\n",
    "1. Maximize total profit\n",
    "2. Meet demand without stockouts\n",
    "3. Minimize waste from expired products\n",
    "4. Balance production line utilization\n",
    "5. Optimize workforce scheduling"
