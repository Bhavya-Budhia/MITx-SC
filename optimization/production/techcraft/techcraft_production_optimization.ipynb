    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "TechCraft builds custom gaming PCs for North American customers. Their flagship product is a high-end gaming rig that customers can customize with different GPUs, cooling systems, and RGB lighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Facilities:\n",
    "- Primary facilities (dedicated lines, must be used):\n",
    "  * Taiwan facility (T1): 1,800 units/month\n",
    "  * Mexico facility (M1): 6,000 units/month\n",
    "  * California facility (C): 1,500 units/month\n",
    "- Optional facilities (can be repurposed):\n",
    "  * Taiwan second line (T2): 2,200 units/month\n",
    "  * Mexico second line (M2): 2,000 units/month\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed Costs for Repurposing:\n",
    "When repurposing a second production line, TechCraft incurs these fixed costs for tooling and setup:\n",
    "- Taiwan second line (T2): $21,100\n",
    "- Mexico second line (M2): $41,700\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Constraints:\n",
    "- All primary production lines must be used\n",
    "- Only one additional line can be repurposed (due to quality control limitations)\n",
    "- Cannot exceed production capacity for any line\n",
    "- Demand must be met exactly (no partial units)\n",
    "- Distribution to two warehouses: Las Vegas (WH1) and Denver (WH2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Demand:\n",
    "- Las Vegas (WH1): 6,000 units\n",
    "- Denver (WH2): 5,200 units\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profit per Unit ($):\n",
