    "# GreenChain: Sustainable Supply Chain Network Design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Background\n",
    "EcoTech, a manufacturer of solar panels and wind turbines, wants to design a sustainable supply chain network that minimizes both costs and carbon emissions. They need to:\n",
    "- Source raw materials from responsible suppliers\n",
    "- Optimize production across facilities\n",
    "- Choose transportation modes balancing speed and emissions\n",
    "- Meet growing renewable energy demand\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Structure\n",
    "- 4 supplier locations (raw materials)\n",
    "- 3 manufacturing facilities\n",
    "- 2 transportation modes (truck, rail)\n",
    "- 6 customer zones\n",
    "- 2 products (solar panels, wind turbines)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Multi-objective optimization to:\n",
    "1. Minimize total costs (production, transportation, fixed facility)\n",
    "2. Minimize carbon emissions\n",
    "3. Maximize supplier sustainability scores\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "1. Meet customer demand\n",
    "2. Respect facility capacities\n",
    "3. Maintain minimum sustainability standards\n",
    "4. Balance modal split for transportation\n",
    "5. Stay within budget"
