# Time Series Forecasting

Techniques and methods for time series analysis in supply chain forecasting.

## Planned Notebooks

### 1. Moving Average Methods (`moving_average.ipynb`)
- Simple moving average
- Weighted moving average
- Centered moving average
- Performance comparison

### 2. Exponential Smoothing (`exponential_smoothing.ipynb`)
- Simple exponential smoothing
- Double exponential smoothing (Holt's method)
- Triple exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters' method)
- Parameter optimization

### 3. Seasonal Decomposition (`seasonal_decomposition.ipynb`)
- Trend analysis
- Seasonal patterns
- Cyclical components
- Residual analysis

### 4. ARIMA Models (`arima_models.ipynb`)
- Model identification
- Parameter estimation
- Model diagnostics
- Forecasting and validation

## Getting Started
Once notebooks are available:
1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scipy
```

2. Open the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Data Sets
Each notebook will include:
- Synthetic data for learning
- Real-world supply chain examples
- Seasonal and non-seasonal cases
- Multi-product scenarios

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand time series components
2. Select appropriate forecasting methods
3. Evaluate forecast accuracy
4. Handle special cases (promotions, holidays)
5. Validate and adjust forecasts

## Contributing
We welcome contributions in:
1. New forecasting techniques
2. Real-world case studies
3. Enhanced visualization methods
4. Additional test cases
