# Supply Chain Forecasting

Methods and techniques for demand forecasting in supply chain management.

## Time Series Analysis
Comprehensive coverage of traditional forecasting methods:
- Moving average methods (simple, weighted, centered)
- Exponential smoothing (simple, Holt's, Holt-Winters')
- Seasonal decomposition (trend, seasonal, cyclical)
- ARIMA models (identification, estimation, diagnostics)

## Machine Learning Approaches
Advanced predictive analytics using machine learning:
- Linear methods (regression, regularization)
- Random forests for demand prediction
- Neural networks (LSTM, CNN)
- Feature engineering for supply chain

## Getting Started

1. Choose your approach:
   - Time series methods for traditional forecasting
   - Machine learning for complex patterns

2. Install required packages:
```bash
# For time series analysis
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scipy

# For machine learning
pip install scikit-learn tensorflow seaborn
```

3. Navigate to the relevant directory:
```bash
cd time_series/    # For traditional methods
cd machine_learning/    # For ML approaches
```

## Learning Path
1. Start with time series fundamentals
2. Progress to advanced statistical methods
3. Explore machine learning applications
4. Practice with real-world cases
