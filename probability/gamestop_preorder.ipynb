For every $50 spent on pre-orders, customers receive one random collector's card from a limited edition set. Sarah has prepared 300 cards total, and once a card is given away, it won't be replaced.\n",

    "   - How would the probabilities change if cards were replaced after each draw?\n",
    "   - What's the probability of getting at least one Legendary Heroes card in 3 draws?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Business Strategy:\n",
    "   - Should GameStop offer different odds for different spending levels?\n",
    "   - How could they optimize the distribution of cards to maximize customer satisfaction?\n",

    "## Mathematical Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, here are the key probability concepts used:\n",
    "1. Single Event Probability: P(A) = n(A)/n(S)\n",
    "2. Conditional Probability: P(B|A) = P(A∩B)/P(A)\n",
    "3. Multiple Event Probability (without replacement): Uses combination formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to account for:\n",
    "- Sample space changes after each draw\n",
    "- Order doesn't matter for multiple events\n",
    "- Total probability must sum to 1"
